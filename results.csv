Senior Inventory Analyst,Trox,"Markham, ON",NaN,"About TROX:
For more than 70 years, we have partnered with Educators and IT Leaders to give them access to an unmatched selection of proven EdTech products and services for the classroom and campus, that enhance the learning experience. As a result, we have helped tens of millions of students in hundreds of thousands of K-12 classrooms and many higher education institutions throughout the US & Canada.
We’re a rapidly growing company focused on selling technology solutions to North American schools. We need help analyzing our product range, managing inventory decisions and setting prices.
A portion of our business comes from traditional distributors and is relatively straight forward to analyse for stock levels, order points, target pricing etc. Another portion comes from purchasing or removing large lots of computer equipment which we refurbish, warranty and resell to schools.
The challenge is in analyzing those large mixed lots to make data driven instead of anecdotal decisions. If you buy a container with 1000 different laptops for $100,000, how do you assign costs to maximize profits and sales? Add in the variable time required to test and refurbish various units, failure rates, shortages in the market and other variables that determine our real cost. Simply averaging will result in low end units that are too expensive and high end units that are too cheap; what should be a simple cost is not so simple.
Similarly, if every tiny variation in specs (i.e. slightly more RAM or a slightly larger hard drive) creates a new SKU, how do you derive meaningful analysis? Some variations are so slight that the SKUs should be considered the same for all analysis purposes.
The ideal candidate will have the skill, experience and desire to solve complex analysis puzzles and the confidence to suggest business practices based on their data despite what general market wisdom might be.
Given the complexity of the computer industry a strong general knowledge of computer hardware is essential.
You will be part of the Purchasing Department and report directly to the Chief Operating Officer while working closely with logistics and development teams to understand and analyse needs, create reports and software, then implement solutions with our warehouse team.
Responsibilities:
Analyze historical and market data to design and implement a cost model that accurately captures costs but does not unduly burden sales
Analyze sales to determine re-order points, minimum and maximum stock levels, lead times necessary to maintain stock, integrate JIT deliveries to maintain production while not crowding the warehouse
Analyze different suppliers and offers to calculate and negotiate the most cost-effective solutions.
